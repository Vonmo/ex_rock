## About

ExRock is NIF for Elixir which uses Rust binding for [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb). Its key features are safety, performance and a minimal codebase. The keys and data are kept binary and this doesnâ€™t impose any restrictions on storage format. So far the project is suitable for being used in third-party solutions.
ExRock is a logical continuation of [Rocker](https://github.com/Vonmo/rocker) - NIF for Erlang

## Installation
The package can be installed by adding `ex_rock` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
```
def deps do
  [{:ex_rock, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

## Performance
In a set of tests you can find a performance test. It demonstrates about 135k write RPS and 2.1M read RPS on my machine. In real conditions we might expect something about 50k write RPS and 400k read RPS with average amount of data being about 1 kB per key and the total number of keys exceeding 1 billion.

* Erlang >= 24.
* Rust >= 1.76.
* Clang >= 15.


## Status
